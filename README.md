## Basic Mongo Theory

MongoDB is a data storage and management ecosystem comprised of many parts. In it's simplest of forms, it consists of the Mongo Server, the Mongo Shell, and whatever databases may exist in the server.

Data is stored, and named different than traditional SQL based databases. In Mongo there are _Collections_ instead of tables, and _Documents_ instead of rows. Like with other database styles, you can have multiple collections.

To access the database programmatically, developers rely on _Mongo Drivers_. Which are packages that allow of the same capabilities of the Mongo Shell, but in various coding languages, i.e. Python, JavaScript, Java, C# and so forth.
