# Notes

Mongo is really a huge ecosystem for development.

There is the Mongo Server, which houses the databases and data, and the Shell, where you can interact with those databases.

Mongo Server is not running by default and will need to be started before you can start the Shell.

## Commands

`mongod` - Starts the Mongo Server

`mongo` - Starts the shell, and connects to Mongo Server

Note: Make sure to keep the server process open or the shell cannot connect to the database.
